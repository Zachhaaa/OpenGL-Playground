Fix the resize bug:
  - Prevent crash when window height = 0 due to divsion in glm::perspective aspect ratio parameter (set minimum window size)
  - Make the resize actually look normal and not change the shape of the cube.
 
Add player look around movement (control with middle mouse)
  - Also make it so the player movment is aligned with the direction the character is looking.
