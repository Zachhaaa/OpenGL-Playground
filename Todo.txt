Before moving on in OpenGL:

  Make a reset button for materials.
  allow for certain constants to be changed not just the color vectors for each Phong component

Continue on learnOpenGl

Optimizations:

Send uniforms in bulk
  -Pass a struct to a uniform through an array and then cast that array into the coresponding types in the shader

Look at ways to optimize the Fragment Shader
  -Learn how reflecting a vector works
  -Instead of normalizing vectors, try dividing by the magnitude after computing dot product.

BUGS:

-fix assert on window minimize caused by perspective function from glm
-fix clear and swapbuffers in render function because I need it to use during resize event
